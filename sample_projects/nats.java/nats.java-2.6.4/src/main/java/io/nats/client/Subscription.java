/**
 * A Subscription encapsulates an incoming queue of messages associated with a single
 * subject and optional queue name. Subscriptions can be in one of two modes. Either the
 * subscription can be used for synchronous reading of messages with {@link #nextMessage(Duration) nextMessage()}
 * or the subscription can be owned by a Dispatcher. When a subscription is owned by a dispatcher
 * it cannot be used to get messages or unsubscribe, those operations must be performed on the dispatcher.
 * 
 * <p>Subscriptions support the concept of auto-unsubscribe. This concept is a bit tricky, as it involves
 * the client library, the server and the Subscriptions history. If told to unsubscribe after 5 messages, a subscription
 * will stop receiving messages when one of the following occurs:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The subscription delivers 5 messages with next messages, <em>including any previous messages</em>.
 * <li>The server sends 5 messages to the subscription.
 * <li>The subscription already received 5 or more messages.
 * </ul>
 * <p>In the case of a reconnect, the remaining message count, as maintained by the subscription, will be sent
 * to the server. So if you unsubscribe with a max of 5, then disconnect after 2, the new server will be told to
 * unsubscribe after 3.
 * <p>The other, possibly confusing case, is that unsubscribe is based on total messages. So if you make a subscription and
 * receive 5 messages on it, then say unsubscribe with a maximum of 5, the subscription will immediately stop handling messages.
