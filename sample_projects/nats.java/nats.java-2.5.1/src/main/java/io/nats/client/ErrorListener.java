 * <dt>Exceptions</dt>
 * <dd>A Java exception occurred, and was handled by the library.</dd>
 * <dt>Slow Consumers</dt>
 * <dd>One of the connections consumers, Subscription or Dispatcher, is slow, and starting to drop messages.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>All of these problems are reported to the application code using the ErrorListener. The 
 * listener is configured in the {@link Options Options} at creation time.
